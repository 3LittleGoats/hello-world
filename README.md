# hello-world
A repository made to help me learn to use GitHub.

My name is Nathanael.
I've been programming in C++ (Arduino) and Python for about two years (as of 10/05/2021, the day I am writing this).
The goal of my GitHub account is to share projects that I think are interesting and may help someone.
